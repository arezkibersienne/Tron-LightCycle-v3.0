# Tron-LightCycle-v3.0

# JAVA 2D GAME 
**Before making my own version I looked up all over the web , I didn't find a version with an easy and explicit code that everyone could understand , So I did my best to make every thing clear , well structred and commented.
I didn't use an Array to make my cycles , and to detecte collision instead of a box I used color detection.**

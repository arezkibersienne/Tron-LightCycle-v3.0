# Tron-LightCycle-v3.0

# JAVE 2D GAME 
**Before making my own version i looked up all over the web , i didn't find a version with an easy and explicit code that everyone could understand , So i did my best to make every thing clear , well structred and commented.
I didn't use an Array to make my cycles , and to detecte collision instead of a box i used colors detection.**
